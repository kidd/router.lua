* what
  This is an implementation of a router for an http server.  This is
  old work of mine (Raimon Grau) from 2013.

  - It uses a home made radix trie implementation.
  - It does too much copying of tables (I was starting with lua, and
    deep into lisp, so the code is quit lispy)
  - recursion, yay
  - it detects collisions
  - it gives more precedence to fixed strings rather than wildcards,
    so '/foo/bar/baz' and '/foo/:bar/baz' do not conflict

  - Raimon Grau <raimonster@gmail.com>.

  - This is part of APITools project. the repo lived on at
    https://github.com/APItools/router.lua/, but I wanted to have the
    pristine initial code I wrote, with all good and bad aspects.  If
    you want to use this code, check the official repo. It probably
    improved. And it has an OOP interface.
* when
  2013

* why
  - The code was used in APITools project.
